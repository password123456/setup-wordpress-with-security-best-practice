This security guide is written with the purpose of being suitable for web applications developed using WordPress, where there is no interaction with users. Typically, it applies to corporate brand pages, various static views, recruitment pages, and the like.

For websites developed with a user registration (membership) and freely posting content nature (hereinafter referred to as open communities), some items in the guide may not align with the nature of such sites. Please keep this in mind as you read.

It does not encompass all security-related content applicable to WordPress. 
However, it is written to a level where it includes general but detailed information, allowing for security risk assessments and vulnerability responses based on the guide.
